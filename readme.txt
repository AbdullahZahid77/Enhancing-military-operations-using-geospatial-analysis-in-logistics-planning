The code is very simple to run, just place the folder on desktop, open the code.ipynb folder and click run all.
The code runs perfectly. Some code blocks will take some time to run espically where selecting 500 polygons will take upto 1 minute
The last code block where the routes are created in the html file, takes up to 8-9 minutes to run, don't interupt the execution.
I have provided the final html file just in case

The code is generic and will work for any country as long as appropriate datasets are provided along with proper coordinates.

Datasets:
Population Tiff file,
Airports pandas data frame,
USA mainland,
USA border

All datasets have been taken from sites data.gov, and have been manually cleaned by code

In the final output file there might be points which might be not labelled on google maps as airports on the map, as they are rather a few helipads or other types of airfields. This is because the dataset is not perfect 

Final output provided in all_routes_map.html. simply open it on the browser to view the results of the routes.
